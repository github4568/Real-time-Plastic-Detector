# Real-time-Plastic-Detector
This project is a real-time plastic detection system using YOLOv8 (a pretrained model) and smartphone camera. It identifies only plastic objects like bottles, wrappers, bags, containers, etc. while ignoring non-plastic items like metal, water, cardboard, glass, organic waste, wood, cloth and paper. 

# Dataset
The dataset consists of 7832 augmented images sourced from kaggle and over 2000 hand-clicked images. All the images are annotated and categorized into two classes: Plastic and Non-Plastic, in a 2:1 ratio. Annotation was done using Roboflow, which also splits the dataset into train, validation and test sets. You can even adjust the ratios. This dataset is split into 70:20:10 ratio. A downloadable ZIP is included in this repository.

# Tech-Stack
- **Python**<br>
- **Ultralytics** : For importing and training the YOLO model.<br>
- **OpenCV**: For real-time video streaming and displaying predictions.<br>
- **Google Colab** : Used for model training with GPU acceleration.<br> 
- **IP WebCam** (Android) / **EpocCam by Elgato** (iPhone) : Streams mobile video 
  to your system.<br>
- **VS Code** : Local development and exceution environment.

# Installation

Make sure you have [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed.  
I highly recommend creating a virtual environment in the folder where you will be running the Python codes.

1. Shift your terminal from PowerShell to Command Prompt.  
2. Copy the following commands to create and activate your virtual environment:

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows
venv\Scripts\activate

# On macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```
# Training
Train your model on Google Colab for faster GPU-based training. We recommend training for at least 100 epochs (ideal). Save last.pt file after every 5 epochs to avoid losing progress due to runtime disconnections. If GPU credits are exceeded, switch to another Gmail account and resume training. You can also train on VS Code using CPU, but it is significantly slower.


# How to Run
1. Update your phoneâ€™s IP address in phone.py. After launching the IP Webcam app or EpocCam, scroll to the bottom and click Start Server. Copy the IP address it shows (e.g., http://192.168.0.101:8080) and update it in your phone.py file like this:
```python
url = "http://<your-ip-address>/shot.jpg"
```
2. Run the python script:
```bash
python phone.py
```
3. A live detection window will open, showing bounding boxes around detected plastic objects.

# Demo
Ensure both your mobile device and laptop are connected to the same Wi-Fi network. You can move freely within range and still detect plastic in real time. For example, plastic objects in the hall were successfully detected even when the laptop running the model remained in the living room.
